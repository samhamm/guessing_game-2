Guessing Game Repository

Benton:
Guessing game will prompt you to input answer to supplied question, enter your answer in the prompt window and submit it
and the program will evaluate your input return an answer in the form of an alert.

Ruben:
Benton and I decided to include a prompt in our code asking for the user's name. The newly acquired information 
becomes evident in our next prompt where we include the user's name to ask the main guessing question. Also, 
we decided to incorporate a while loop so that the game does not end when the user gets it wrong. It keeps going
until they get it right. Both additions can be seen in each of our games.
